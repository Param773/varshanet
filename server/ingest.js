// module is different: it genuinely calls a live, free public weather API
// (Open-Meteo, no key required — the same one server/weather.js already
// uses for scoring) for 200 Indian cities, and whenever a city is
// *currently* experiencing notable weather, it auto-creates a real report
// from that live reading.
